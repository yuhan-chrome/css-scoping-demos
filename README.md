# CSS scoping

CSS scoping is a technique that enables you to apply a set of CSS rules to a subtree of the DOM. The benefits are style encapsulation, reduced selector naming conflicts, and boost performance via fewer nodes to traverse during style recalcs. CSS scoping can be achieved via BEM, CSS preprocessors, JS Frameworks, or web components. However,  limitations to the current approaches call for a native solution. Demos will discuss some of these approaches. The [explainer](explainer.md) will discuss the design proposal.
