# CSS scoping

CSS scoping is a technique that enables you to apply a set of CSS rules to a subtree of the DOM. Currently,CSS scoping can be achieved via BEM, CSS preprocessors, JS Frameworks, or web components. However, limitations to the current approaches call for a native solution. Demos,[coming soon], will discuss some of these approaches. The [explainer](explainer.md) will discuss the design proposal.
